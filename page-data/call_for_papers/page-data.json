These will be incorporated into the proceedings and presented as 10 to 20-minute talks during paper sessions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Practitioner Track</strong> (500 words abstract): Short articles by game developers, artists, and other practitioners on the use of artificial intelligence in games, art, and other entertainment artifacts. These will be highlighted by 5-10 minute talks in a special track of the workshop. Ideally, these will also use the AAAI format, but for the initial submission, any PDF format is fine; we’ll assign an editor to assist with the formatting of accepted work. The abstracts for this track do not have to be anonymized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Informal project demos</strong>: These require a (2 pages max) description of the project and why you think it's interesting. We welcome works-in-progress, finished projects, and prototypes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any appendices may be a maximum of two (2) pages.</p>\n<h2>Special Theme</h2>\n<p>In keeping with this year’s AIIDE 'Mis-Spun Tales' theme, we specifically invite authors to submit their negative results. Discussing negative results help our research community to critically consider the underlying assumptions of our work or the evaluation methods we use. Authors are strongly encouraged to include a discussion of what we can learn from negative results and what future work they inspire.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates</h2>\n<p>Deadline for paper submissions:  <strong>August 10, 2022</strong></p>\n<p>Notification for accepted papers: <strong>August 26, 2022</strong> <del>August 22, 2022</del></p>\n<p>Workshop date: <strong>October 24 - 25, 2022</strong></p>\n<h2>Submission Guide</h2>\n<p>Please submit using <a href=\"https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=aiide22\">EasyChair</a>.</p>\n<p>All papers submitted to the research track must follow the <a href=\"https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip\">AAAI format</a> and be anonymized for double-blind review.</p>\n<h2>Topics</h2>\n<p>This is a non-comprehensive list of topics of interest to EXAG:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New technology or tools made possible by AI—anything from roguelike Unexplored’s procedurally-generated dungeons and puzzles to stealth game Third Eye Crime’s visualization of AI logic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New games and related projects powered by academic research, e.g., Sure Footing and Bad News.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Better living through AI—improving the game development and design process via new or newly applied AI techniques, from intelligent design tools to automated QA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AI in physical/embodied play environments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AI in support of mixed-initiative co-creative play.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New applications of traditional AI techniques, e.g., Left 4 Dead’s drama manager or Black and White’s learning creatures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cross-pollination from AI subfields not typically involved in games—anything from computational linguistics to machine vision.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Case studies on the provenance of widely adopted technologies that were once considered experimental, e.g., the history of behavior trees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reports on failed experiments related to any topic in our purview with a particular focus on how others can learn from your experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not sure if your topic is a fit?

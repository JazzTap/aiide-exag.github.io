Discussing negative\n                        results help our research community to critically\n                        consider the underlying assumptions of our work or the\n                        evaluation methods we use. Authors are strongly\n                        encouraged to include a discussion of what we can learn\n                        from negative results and what future work they inspire.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>\n                        We hope to see you at EXAG!
